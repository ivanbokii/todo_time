the plan:
  - reserved words like _at_, _oclock_
  - word numbers - one, two etc.
  - modifiers - am, pm

what this accomplishes?
  - more targeted patterns

like: 
  - 7:00 - {number colon number} - standard time
  - 7 am, 7am - {number modifier}
  - 8 - {number} - by default uses current part of day
  - at seven oclock {reserved number reserved}
  - seven {number}

so, the task is:
  - add more information to tokens during parsing
    - save initial value
    - save type
    - parse value of word number
